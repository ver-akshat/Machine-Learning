# Machine-Learning algorithms from scratch
Here I am implementing commonly used Machine learning algorithms from scratch in python
Till now I have implemented Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree & Naive Bayes algorithms from scratch.
In some of these I have implemented their main variants also like: Naive Bayes has 2 implementations, Bernoulli NB and Gaussian NB.
Similarly Decision tree has 2 implementations: using ID3 algorithm and CART algorithm.
My main focus here was to know the working of these algorithms so I have not paid attention to the accuracy.
